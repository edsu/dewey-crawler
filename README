dewey-crawler is a simplistic, single threaded, possibly daft, crawler for 
Dewey Decimal Classification Summaries at http://dewey.info from the folks
at OCLC.

More information about the data at http://dewey.info can be found at:

  http://www.worldcat.org/devnet/wiki/DeweyInfoTechOverview

After a crawl you'll have a rdflib berkelydb triple store on disk, and 
a dump of all the triples as turtle and rdf/xml.

Usage:
./crawl.py

Dependencies:
rdflib 3.0
