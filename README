dewey-crawler is a simplistic, single threaded, possibly daft, crawler for 
Dewey Decimal Classification Summaries at http://dewey.info from the folks
at OCLC.

More information about the data at http://dewey.info can be found at:

  http://www.worldcat.org/devnet/wiki/DeweyInfoTechOverview

After a crawl you'll have a rdflib berkelydb triple store on disk. You can
then run dump.py to generate dewey.rdf, dewey.ttl and dewey.json.

Usage:
./crawl.py
./dump.py

Dependencies:
rdflib 3.0
