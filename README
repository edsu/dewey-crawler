dewey-crawler is a simplistic, single threaded, possibly daft, crawler for 
Dewey Decimal Classification Summaries at http://dewey.info from the folks
at OCLC. The idea is to be able to pull down the summaries to make it 
easier to reference the resources in your linked data application.

More information about the data at http://dewey.info can be found at:

  http://www.worldcat.org/devnet/wiki/DeweyInfoTechOverview

After a crawl you'll have a rdflib berkelydb triple store on disk. You can
then run dump.py to generate dewey.rdf, dewey.ttl and dewey.json.

Usage:
./crawl.py
./dump.py

Dependencies:
rdflib 3.0
